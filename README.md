# LangChain Applications 

There are 5 different studies within the scope of this repo;

1- The study is in the form of a streamlit application, and a simple comparison of the LangChain structure, which includes 
model.py and modelhelper.py files, and OpenAI, Google and Anthropic models

2- The operation of the LangChain structure with chain_exp.py and chain.py and the operation of the query mechanism in the class structure are discussed.

3- Working with the loaders.py file and the operation of the "retrival" mechanism via URL, PDF, Excel, which are different content loading types within the LangChain structure

4- The study is in the form of a streamlit application, and the splitter_comparison.py file is compared with the splitter types in LangChain, 
namely Character, Recursive, Semantic splitter structures.

5- The study is in the form of a streamlit application, and the operation of the RAG-Retrival Augmented Generation approach in LangChain, which includes
rag.py and raghelper.py files, works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace embedding models in both URL and PDF formats.
